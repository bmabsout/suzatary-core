/*
 * THE HOME SCREEN, SHOWING WHAT IS MOST OWED.
 *
 * A WIDGET IS A RENDERING OF THE BOX'S FOLD AND NOTHING ELSE. Every number
 * below came out of `GET /api/fold?limit=5` as a string and is put on the
 * screen as that string; every line of text is `Authored.body` as the chain
 * stores it. This class holds no fold, no FPL interpreter, no spec, no clock
 * arithmetic and no idea what "fulfillment" means — which is the same rule
 * MainActivity states for the WebView (no fold, no fulfillment, no verifier)
 * one surface further out, and the rule this repository has already enforced
 * twice by deleting a second evaluator.
 *
 * THE NUMBER IS NOT TURNED INTO A PERCENTAGE HERE. `value * 100` looks like
 * formatting and is arithmetic on a fulfillment, and the moment this file does
 * one piece of that it is a place where the number on a phone can disagree
 * with the number on the box. The web app has ONE renderer for a fulfillment
 * (`web/src/view/format.ts`), it is in TypeScript, and there is nothing on the box
 * to reuse from Java — so this prints what the JSON spells, and the reader who
 * wants it as a percentage taps the row and gets the app.
 *
 * IDENTITY IS THE TAILNET'S, exactly as for the WebView. The request carries no
 * credential and no token: `tailscale whois` names the phone's login, so a fold
 * this widget can read is a fold a browser tab on the same phone can read, and
 * removing the device from the tailnet takes both. It sends NO
 * `X-Suzatary-Act` header, because that header is the CSRF half of a WRITE
 * (`gate::check_csrf`) and this widget never writes anything at all. HTTPS
 * only, like Push and the WebView: a widget
 * that cannot reach the box shows the rows it last saw and says how old they
 * are, which is a better answer than downgrading a connection nobody is
 * watching.
 *
 * NOTHING OF OURS RUNS BETWEEN TWO UPDATES. This is a BroadcastReceiver, like
 * PushReceiver: the system wakes the process, the fetch happens on a thread
 * held open by goAsync, the rows are handed to the launcher and the process
 * goes away. No service, no job, no alarm — the same requirement push was
 * built to satisfy, and the reason updatePeriodMillis (res/xml/widget_info.xml)
 * is the system's batched wake-up rather than a timer of ours.
 *
 * EVERY ANDROID DETAIL BELOW IS REVERSE-DOCUMENTED OR DOCUMENTED, and each one
 * says which and how confident, the way Push.java does for the C2DM protocol.
