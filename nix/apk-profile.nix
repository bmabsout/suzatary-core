# An APK PROFILE: what one person's Android portal is built with, read from a
# TOML file and refused at evaluation when it is not one. The generic profile
# (android/profile/generic.toml) is empty; docs/APKPROFILE-PLAN-2026-10-23.md
# lists the fields later stages add.
#
#   box    = "<name>.<tailnet>.ts.net"   the box the portal opens, asked at
#                                        first launch when absent
#   sender = "<digits>"                  that box's Firebase project number;
#                                        absent, the portal registers for no push
#
# The result is a sum: { box = null; } for the generic APK, or
# { box = { host; sender; }; } with sender null for a box that sends no push.
