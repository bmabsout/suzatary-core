//! Which salted words may go: a text something names and nothing live names.
//!
//! Every history that names texts answers a [`Naming`]: each text it names, and whether that
//! naming is still live (a standing fact, a card the owner may still tap). A naming is a map into
//! the two-point lattice `Past < Live`, joined pointwise, so the namings of every history join
//! into one whatever their order, and a text is dead in the join exactly when it is named and
//! live nowhere. Dead is read of the join, never per history and then united: the words of a
//! dismissed card stay while the fact it became stands.
//!
//! A naming is typed by the words its texts are, so by the store they are kept in: the facts' and
//! the digest's summaries' are two stores, and a naming of one joins only with a naming of the
//! same, so a sweep can delete a text only from the store whose histories named it.
//!
//! Whether a text is dead is not monotone (a forgetting makes one), so the sweep asks it under
//! ONE hold, the memory's ([`crate::secretary::memories::Held`]), and every writer that files a
//! naming of a text into that store takes the same hold first: a fact remembered, a remember card
//! filed or tapped. A writer that names texts without it could name one the sweep has just found
//! dead. A sweep that cannot read every naming deletes nothing, since the words are box-local and
//! a wrong deletion is final.
