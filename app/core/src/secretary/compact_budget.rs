//! What the compactor may spend: a cap on calls an hour and on bytes sent a day, read against
//! the attempts the digest's history records, so the budget is a fold over the digest's own
//! objects and a restart forgets nothing it spent.
//!
//! Both windows are rolling and end at the instant asked about. A call is made only when what
//! the windows spent, joined with what the call itself will spend, is within both caps, so no
//! call crosses a cap by its own size: the caps are a down-set of the [`Spent`] monoid.
