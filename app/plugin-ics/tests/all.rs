//! Every integration test of this crate as one binary: one link of the whole
//! application instead of one per file. Each file stays where it was and reads
//! as it did on its own; a file under `tests/` that is not a module here, or a
//! target of its own in `Cargo.toml`, does not run, and `suites.rs` in the
//! cli's tests fails when one is missing.
