/**
 * The keyed list's plan.
 *
 * The property that matters is not "the ops are minimal" but "applying them

 * `card.ts` drives the DOM, over hand-picked shapes and then over a few hundred
 * random ones. Minimality is checked separately, because it is the whole point:
 * a plan that moved every node would be correct and would still throw away the
 * scroll position this exists to keep.
