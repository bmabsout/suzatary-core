/**
 * The cached fold.
 *
 * Two properties. It is SLIM — the two fields that make a fold megabytes never
 * reach `localStorage`, and a regression there would silently stop the cache
 * working at all (a quota exception is swallowed by design). And it is PARSED,
 * not trusted: a cache written by an older build, half-written, or edited by
 * hand becomes `null` and costs one network fetch, never a broken page.
