/**
 * THE REFERENCE GRAMMAR, IN THE BROWSER'S HALF OF IT.
 *
 * `suzatary_core::reference` is the authority: it refuses a reference on the
 * way in and it decides what the stored bytes mean. `web/src/chat/refs.ts` is the
 * SECOND reader, and it exists because the linking happens here, over prose
 * that arrives as one string with no offsets. Two readers of one grammar is
 * exactly the shape this repository normally refuses, so the ones that could
 * disagree are pinned:
 *
 * - THE SIX SPELLINGS are the same six `suzatary_core::reference`'s own test
 *   asserts, character for character. If either side changes one, one of the
 *   two files goes red.
 * - THE ROUND TRIP is a law here as it is there: whatever `print` writes,
 *   `parse` reads back as the same value.
 * - THE TOKENISER LOSES NOTHING: concatenating every token's source is the
 *   input. A scan that silently ate a character would be a page quietly
 *   misquoting the model, which is worse than a missed link.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the DOM: `anchor` and `textWithReferences` build nodes
 * and belong to the browser scenes (`web/e2e/secretary.test.ts`), which is
 * where a link that does not navigate would show up.
