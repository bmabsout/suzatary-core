/**
 * `serial`: one run at a time and one queued behind it. The law is the one an

 * call, so whatever was sealed before calling is in the run that answers it.
 * Coalescing a call into the run already in flight broke exactly that: the
 * run had read what to push before the act existed, and its answer resolved
 * the act's sync as if the act had gone.
