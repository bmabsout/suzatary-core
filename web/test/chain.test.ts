/**
 * THE SLUG GUARD, which is a PARSE and not a formality.
 *
 * `chain.ts`'s own header says what it is for: a chain name is a PATH SEGMENT
 * (`/api/<chain>/fold`), and the selection is remembered in `localStorage`,
 * which is an input from outside the program like any other. A hand-edited or
 * stale entry must not become `/api/../fold` — so the value that comes back is
 * parsed against the same rule `suzatary_core::chains::ChainName` keeps, and a
 * value that is not a slug opens the default chain instead.
 *
 * `theme.ts`'s equivalent three-line guard has had a test since it shipped;
 * this one is the older and the more load-bearing of the two, and had none.
 *
 * What is pinned here is the guard and the BOUNDARY, not the storage: what a
 * browser does with `localStorage` needs a browser, and `kv.ts` already
 * degrades to "no stored value" under node — which is why the default is
 * observable here at all.
