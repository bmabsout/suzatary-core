 * HOW LONG A WAIT IS ALLOWED TO TAKE, and why it is a knob.
 *
 * Every wait in this suite is REAL time — the page holds an SSE connection, so
 * Chromium's virtual-time budgets never expire and polling is the honest way to
 * wait (see this file's header). Real time is a property of the MACHINE, and
 * this suite runs on two very different ones: a box with the chain already warm
 * in its page cache, and a shared GitHub runner starting cold beside two other
 * jobs. A number tuned for the first is a flake on the second, and a number
 * tuned for the second makes every local failure take a minute to report.
 *
 * So it is one environment variable, read once, and CI sets it higher
 * (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`). It is a BUDGET and not a delay: a wait that
 * is satisfied in 40 ms still costs 40 ms whatever this says.
 *
 * A value that is not a positive number is the default, because a mistyped
 * variable that silently made every timeout zero would turn one flake into a
 * suite that cannot pass at all.

 * long that ONE thing takes RELATIVE to everything else, made on a developer's
 * box. Editing fifty numbers to survive a slow runner would be editing fifty
 * judgements; multiplying them by one factor keeps every relative claim and
 * moves the whole suite onto the machine it is running on. Locally the factor
